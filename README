I think I was toying around with the idea of a MUD map editor where you could
drag around the rooms and have them automatically connect with each other when
they got close.

Anyway, this is a little experiment with having "rooms" (boxes) connect together
with lines when they come close enough.

Click on an empty space to create a box, then do it again for another box and
then click inside one of the boxes and hold down the mouse button to drag it
around. You'll see as the boxes get closer together that they get connected with
a line.

The line is positioned according to the angle of the boxes relative to each
other with 8 anchor points: one on each corner and one in the middle of each
side.
